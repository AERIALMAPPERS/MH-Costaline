                <div class="p">
                    <p>Airborne light detection and ranging (lidar) is a remote sensing technology that is proving
                        increasingly beneficial in a variety of ocean and coastal mapping applications. Lidar systems
                        use pulsed lasers in aircraft to measure ranges to the surface below. The range measurements are
                        combined with position and orientation data to obtain accurate, 3D spatial coordinates (e.g.,
                        latitudes, longitudes, and heights) of points on Earth’s surface, as well as elevated features,
                        such as canopy and buildings. In the case of bathymetric lidar, green laser beams are employed
                        for ranging through the water column in order to map bathymetry of shallow coastal waters

                    </p>

                    <div id="additional-content">
                        <br>
                        <p>Lidar surveys are being used to assess the vulnerability of natural resources. Lidar
                            resolution (approximately 1 m × 1 m) allows a broad range of seabed features to be
                            distinguished at many different spatial scales, such as sand waves, island topography, and
                            reefs capes. The high resolution is achieved rapidly over large distances (when there is
                            sufficient water clarity), leading to efficient and effective resource characterization,
                            particularly in relatively shallow and complex coastal areas, such as reefs and wetlands.

                    <p>Bathymetry is the study and mapping of the seabed or lakebed. It consists of obtaining
                        measurements of the depth of the ocean or lakes and is equivalent to the mapping of the earth's
                        topography. In general, only limited information is known about seabed and lake beds. Existing
                        maps of the seabed are often low-resolution or obsolete.
                         
                        In this application, Apache is suitable technology as it can measure depths of up to 300 m and
                        provide its exact GNSS position. The data can be used to estimate silt deposits that scour the
                        channel bottom, etc.

                            The seabed level must be accurately measured to determine whether a vessel can make it to
                            the berthing area or whether dredging is required to create adequate depth. The depth level
                            is required in dam and reservoir areas to calculate the capacity of the dam year after year.
                            Due to the constant movement of water through these dams, siltation causes the bed level to
                            rise, which reduces their overall capacity.

                    <p> A. Drone lidar technology is play an important role in inaccessible coastal areas.
                        B. In places like forests and hills where the trees are dense, normal mapping equipment can have
                        a difficult time determining elevation, but not lidar. You can use it in even a
                        densely covered area to collect elevation information.


                        Lidar Is An Optical Remote-sensing Technology That Can Measure The Distance To, Or Other
                        Properties Of, Targets By Illuminating The Target With Laser Light And Analyzing The
                        Backscattered Light.

                        A LiDAR system uses a laser, a GPS and an IMU to estimate the heights of objects on the ground.
                        Discrete LiDAR data are generated from waveforms -- each point represents peak energy points
                        along the returned energy. Discrete LiDAR points contain an X, Y and Z value.

                        LIDAR point cloud data is a collection of points that describe a surface or an object. Each
                        point is described with x, y, and z coordinates and in some cases is associated with additional
                        attributes such as a classification of the point. LIDAR data is used to extract accurate
                        geo-referenced vector features such as buildings, roads, and trees.
                        <br>
                        Georeferencing means that the internal coordinate system of a digital map or aerial photo can be
                        related to a ground system of geographic coordinates. A georeferenced digital map or image has
                        been tied to a known Earth coordinate system, so users can determine where every point on the
                        map or aerial photo is located on the Earth's surface.
                        allows the integration of spatial data from different sources. It allows for the use of data for
                        a variety of purposes such as analysis, planning, decision making and documenting among others.
                        Georeferencing also makes it possible to have standardization in the spatial data by allowing it
                        to be compatible to any software used in GIS without causing difficulties.
                        Georeferencing also enables the geographic information system to easily incorporate data from
                        different sources including satellite images and maps into a single database.

                        The coastline paradox of a landmass has no defined length. Depending on the scale used, the
                        coastline may be larger or smaller.

                        Rectification of coastline concerning the drone image. The red line marked on google earth the
                        line does not match the drone image. The coastline can rectify with respect to the drone image.
